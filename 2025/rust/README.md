# Advent of Code 2025 - Rust

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges, implemented in Rust.

## How to Run

Every day's solutions are organized into separate modules. In order to run them use the test command with the specific day you want to execute. For example, to run the solution for Day 1, use:

```bash
cargo test day1 -- --nocapture
```

Make sure to replace `day1` with the appropriate day number for other challenges.

## Template script

To create a new day's solution, you can use the provided template script. This script will generate the necessary files and structure for the new day's challenge.

```bashbash
./create_day.sh <day_number>
```

Replace `<day_number>` with the desired day number (e.g., `2` for Day 2).
